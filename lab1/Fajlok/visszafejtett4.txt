Why is cryptography interesting?

Firstly, cryptography is a classical subject with a fascinating history. Encryption techniques have been used since ancient times, but the protection against exposure was sometimes dubious and many ciphers were broken. The design of new ciphers and the capability to analyze and break them co-evolved over time. Since then, the techniques have been adapted to progress in cryptanalysis and to the computing power available. Modern cryptography goes beyond confidentiality, also addressing aspects such as data integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and other security objectives. The subject now includes all mathematical techniques relating to information security.

Secondly, cryptography is closely connected to several fields of mathematics and computer science, providing interesting applications for many theoretical results and stimulating mathematical research. Cryptography, which we use as an umbrella term for the field including cryptanalysis, is linked to aspects of discrete mathematics, number theory, algebra, probability theory, statistics, information and coding theory.

Thirdly, cryptography has become a key technology that is used ubiquitously in computer systems from small devices to large servers and networks. The multitude of security threats is driving the trend to protect data whenever possible, be it for storage or during transmission over networks. The reader should be warned, however, that real-world security is a complex process in which cryptography contributes "only" the primitives, algorithms and schemes. In practice, attacks often exploit protocol or implementation flaws, weak passwords or negligent users. Furthermore, the security guarantees offered by cryptography cannot be unconditional. The security provided depends on the power of adversaries, their computing resources and the time available for an attack, as well as on underlying computational problems which are believed to be hard.
